# CleanArchitecture
this is a demonstration of how to implement the clean architecture on a nodejs project and typescript
The secret to building a large project that is easy to maintain and performs better is to separate files
and classes into components that can change independently without affecting other components: this is what Clean Architecture is all about.
Clean Architecture is an architectural style created by Robert C. Martin.
It is a set of standards that aims to develop an application that makes it easier to quality code that will perform better, 
is easy to maintain, and has fewer dependencies as the project grows.
Microservices and serverless architecture have emerged as revolutionary architectural patterns in the software development
world during the last several years. Each has its characteristics, behaviors, technological structure, and required expertise.
However, they are all part of a broader desire for a better separation of architecture concerns and improved testability.
There are four concentric circles in Clean Architecture that each represents different areas of Software, which are as below:
*Entities
*Use Cases
*Interface Adapters
*Frameworks and Drivers.
